To create a virtual environment(That (venv) prefix means it worked. Every time you open this project in a new terminal session, you need to run this activation command first. This is the #1 thing beginners forget.):
python -m venv venv

To run the project:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Part 2 — A simple mental model you can say out loud
Every time you open this project, ask yourself these 3 questions:
"Where does a request come in?"
Always main.py → the function under the matching @app.get or @app.post decorator.
"Where does data live?"
Right now: in memory (a Python list inside main.py). Soon: PostgreSQL database via database.py.
"Where does business logic go?"
Inside the endpoint functions for now. Later we'll move complex logic into separate service files.
